// 7. Apply EPS to S mode

// PAP - lower trigger threshold with cumulative volume - most non-inhales only reach 10-15mL, most ineffective efforts reach 25-30mL, and with p_error(only if recent commanded volume was constant)
// 20-40mL for -0%-25% threshold 5-15 for +0%-25%
// Previously did 0.05-0.3cmH2O p_error to 3cmH2O, or -62.5% threshold, though baseline was 1.5cmH2O higher, so more like -30% ?
